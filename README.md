# Parkinson-Disease-Detection-Using-Vocal-Frequency
This project uses vocal frequency patterns for the detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). It employs machine learning techniques, including Deep Learning and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify speech recordings as indicative of PD or not. The system aims to provide early, non-invasive, and cost-effective detection for PD.
