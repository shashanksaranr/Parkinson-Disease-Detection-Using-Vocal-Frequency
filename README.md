# Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Vocal Frequency

This project uses vocal frequency patterns for the detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). It employs machine learning techniques, including Deep Learning and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to classify speech recordings as indicative of PD or not. The system aims to provide early, non-invasive, and cost-effective detection for PD.

# üöÄ Features

Collects speech samples from both healthy individuals and Parkinson's patients.

Extracts vocal features like pitch, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR).

Trains a machine learning model to classify the voice recordings.

Provides a Streamlit web interface for easy testing.

Evaluates the model's performance with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

# üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
